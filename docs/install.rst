Installation
------------

To use this project, first install it using **pip**:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install basic-pid


The main python package download site is `here <https://pypi.org/project/basic-pid/>`_

**BasicPID** as of version 0.2.7 no longer requires **robo-base** to be installed 
and can be used as a standalone module.

Previous versions required **robo-base** to be installed first. This is usually flagged as a 
dependency when installing using **pip**. If not then manually install.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install robo-base
